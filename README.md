# Word to Abbreviation

## Implementation

An HTTP Go server that returns an `index.html` file. This page contains some HTML, using Tailwind CSS through the CDN for styling, that allows a user to input a word and convert it to an abbreviation. The word is sent to the backend, which returns the associated abbreviation. Currently, no abbreviation mechanism is implemented, so the backend will just return `"Not Implemented!".
